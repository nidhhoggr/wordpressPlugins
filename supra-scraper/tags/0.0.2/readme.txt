== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is some more information about this plugin? =

read the organized documentation provided in the docs tab of the plugin. The support forum
is also a great tool and the author of the plugin is very responsive in addressing a multitude of issues
and questions.

= What is taking so long?? =
One reason why the scraping process may be taking so long is that you are trying to scrape a link that is https://. To quicken the process be sure to stay away from https:// links. The will work but the scraper has to work extra hard to grab the content.

Another reason may be that you are trying to scrape a huge page with a ton of content. If all of the links you are scraping have the same theme its a good idea to utilize the content selector to limit the amount of content being saved to the posts.
