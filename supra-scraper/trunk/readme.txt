== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is some more information about this plugin? =
In addition to the tooltips provided in the various interfaces of the plugin you can also
read the organized documentation provided in the docs tab of the plugin. The support forum
is also a great tool and the author of the plugin is very responsive in addressing a multitude of issues
and questions.

= What is taking so long?? =
One reason why the scraping process may be taking so long is that you are trying to scrape a link that is https://. To quicken the process be sure to stay away from https:// links. The will work but the scraper has to work extra hard to grab the content.

Another reason may be that you are trying to scrape a huge page with a ton of content. If all of the links you are scraping have the same theme its a good idea to utilize the content selector to limit the amount of content being saved to the posts.
